    * **Verified Inlining and Specialisation for PureCake**
    *
    * Inlining is a crucial optimisation when compiling functional programming
    * languages. This paper describes how we have implemented and verified
    * function inlining and loop specialisation for PureCake, a verified
    * compiler for a Haskell-like (purely functional, lazy) programming
    * language. A novel aspect of our formalisation is that we justify inlining
    * by pushing and pulling -bindings. All of our work has been mechanised in
    * the HOL4 interactive theorem prover.
