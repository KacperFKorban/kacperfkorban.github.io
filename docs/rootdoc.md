I'm Kacper Korban. I am a PhD student at EPFL (SystemF/LAMP).

My interests are in between formal verification (interactive theorem proving) and programming languages (compilers and types).

If you want to read more about me check the **API** below and if you want to check out some of my blog posts, head to [**Docs**](./docs/blog/index.html).
